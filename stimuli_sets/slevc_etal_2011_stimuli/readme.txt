These stimuli are synthesized sounds that cross linguistic status (speech or nonspeech sounds) with acoustic cue type (temporal or spectral):

The speech/temporal stimuli make up a ba/da continuum where the F2 transition changes the perceived place of articulation (~800-1100 Hz = /b/; 1200-1600 Hz = /d/) and where the duration of the transition is short (20ms), medium (40ms), or long (60ms).  These are represented in the soundfile names, for example:

ba8-20.wav <-- 800 Hz onset, 20 ms sweep
ba16-60.wav <-- 1600 Hz onset, 60 ms sweep

The nonspeech/temporal are just sinewave analogues of the above, with the same naming convention (so ns8-20.wav is the analogue to ba8-20.wav)

The speech/spectral stimuli are from a "bee" to "bay" 9-point continuum where items 1 & 3 are "bee" and 7 and 9 are "bay".  The non-speech analogues are sinewave versions of each vowels' F2 frequency plus a little onset sweep that matches the F2 contour of "b".
